This report presents the development and evaluation of a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) system based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The system integrates embedded hardware, biomedical sensors, and full-stack web technologies to enable patients to measure and transmit vital health data. Key functionalities include NFC-based user authentication, secure data handling, and a role-based web interface for patients and healthcare professionals. The system demonstrates a cost-effective, extensible prototype of RPM solutions.
